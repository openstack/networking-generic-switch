    Fixed incorrect command when unplugging bond subports.
    Previously, when a bond was unplugged from a network with trunk subports,
    the system would incorrectly try to add subports instead of removing them.
    This bug has been fixed, and the system now uses the correct command to remove subports,
    ensuring proper bond cleanup.
