    It is now possible to add security group support to existing drivers. This
    is implemented as a neutron service plugin and can be enabled by appending
    ``genericswitch_security_group`` to the neutron configuration
    ``[DEFAULT]service_plugins`` list. The security group feature is limited to
    applying one security group to a port.

    The first driver to have security group support added is ``netmiko_cisco_nxos``.
    Limitations specific to this driver are:

    * Only ingress rules allowed
    * Only IPv4 rules are implemented
    * Supports rules for protocols: tcp, udp, icmp
