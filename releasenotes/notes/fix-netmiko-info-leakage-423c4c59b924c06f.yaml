    Fixes a security vulnerability where sensitive information (IP addresses,
    usernames, hostname and file paths) were leaked in error messages when a
    connection to a network device fails. Error messages are now properly
    sanitized to redact these sensitive details while preserving meaningful
    information for troubleshooting.
