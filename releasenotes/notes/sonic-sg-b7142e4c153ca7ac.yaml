    The ``netmiko_sonic`` driver now supports security groups on upstream
    distributions of SONiC, supporting the following:

    * Ingress and egress rules
    * IPv4 and IPv6
    * Rule filters for IP protocols TCP, UDP and ICMP

    The security group (ACL) implementation of Dell Enterprise SONiC 4.5
    diverges from upstream enough to require the addition of a new driver
    ``netmiko_dell_enterprise_sonic``. This driver should be specified when
    running this distribution of SONiC on Dell hardware.

    Dell Enterprise SONiC 4.5 also lacks support for ICMP filter rules, and
    this is enforced by ``netmiko_dell_enterprise_sonic``.
