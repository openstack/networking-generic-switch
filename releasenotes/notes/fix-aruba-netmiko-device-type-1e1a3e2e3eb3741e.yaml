    Any Aruba AOS-CX device using the "aruba_os" device type in its configuration
    needs a configuration update.  The device type should be replaced with
    "aruba_aoscx".

    Fix Netmiko device type for Aruba AOS-CX.  The previously-used device type,
    "aruba_os", is meant for wireless controllers, not for switches running
    AOS-CX.  As a result, trying to run any command over SSH with Netmiko would
    fail on Aruba AOS-CX switches.
