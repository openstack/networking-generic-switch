Creating new device plugins
===========================

#. Subclass the abstract class
   ``networking_generic_switch.devices.GenericSwitch``
   and implement all the abstract methods it defines.

   * Your class must accept as first argument a dictionary that contains
     all fields given in the device config section of the ML2 plugin config.
     This will be available as ``self.config`` in the instantiated object.
     The second argument is the device name as specified in the configuration.
     It is recommended to accept and pass ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` to the
     __init__ method of the parent class: this helps to stay compatible with
     future changes of the base class.

#. Register your class under ``generic_switch.devices`` entrypoint.
#. Add your device config to the plugin configuration file
   (``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_genericswitch.ini`` by default).
   The only required option is ``device_type`` that must be equal to the
   entrypoint you have registered your plugin under, as it is used for plugin
   lookup (see provided ``Netmiko``-based plugins for example).


Additional Contributor Resources
================================
GenericSwitch is a member of the Bare Metal (ironic) program in OpenStack.
Development of GenericSwitch follows many ironic conventions.

The `Ironic developer quickstart <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/contributor/dev-quickstart.html>_`
has some relevant information -- particularly on unit testing with tox,
integration testing with devstack, and other information that may be useful
for GenericSwitch developers. As the documentation is written targeting
Ironic, it should only be used as a general guideline.
